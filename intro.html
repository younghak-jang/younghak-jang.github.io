	<h2>Individual Commodity Prices</h2>
		<h3>1. Project Concept</h3>
		<p>Trading commodities - oil, coffee, gold, corn, wheat - is complex.  Such products are exchanged by buying and selling futures contracts.  These contracts promise that the seller of the contract will deliver to the buyer an agreed upon amount of the commodity at a particular location on a particular date in the future.</p>
        <p>At any one time, several futures contracts with different delivery dates are trading for each commodity.  Therefore, there is no single price that can be quoted.  Traders must track this stream of prices.  This is both a data manipulation challenge and an information processing challenge.</p>
